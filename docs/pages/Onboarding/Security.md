# Security

This project has a lot of important pieces of information that need to be kept private. They mostly split into 2 catagories:

## User Data

Each year over 1200 first year students trusts us with important piece of information that we must protect and keep safe. Never disclose any Frosh data to anyone and do not give access to anyone.

## API Keys

Additionally, there are a lot of services that have private API keys that we use to authenticate ourselves. These are services that can be used to imitate us and get access to our information which can lead to data exposure or financial issues.

Therefor, you need to make sure to **NEVER COMMIT ANYTHING THAT HAS A SECRET IN PLAIN TEXT.**

Incase that does happen, let the webmasters know **ASAP**. 

## Password Manager

If you are able to please use a password manager to keep all the passwords that we give you.
