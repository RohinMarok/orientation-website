# Documentation

For this project you will be expected to develop documentation for your code. This is done in two parts, the first is in code comments such as line commends and function docstrings, the second one is the thing you are reading right now. 

We will ask you to contribute to these documents as you develop code for the project. The full nature of which we will explain during our meetings. The following is a guideline on how to contribute to the documentation. 


## Adding to this website

This website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) website that is auto generated based on [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files which is running the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme. 

To add a new page you just create a file with the `.md` extension for markdown inside the `/docs/pages` folder.
